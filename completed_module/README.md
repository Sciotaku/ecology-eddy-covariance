This repository contains all the components of the data science module for Dartmouth College's ABCD 00: A course you'd like to take.  Click the icon next to the course name above to download the entire module.

## Primary Objective

The primary objective for this module is to bridge the gap for students between raw data and insights that can be achieved from eddy covariance data 


## Student Expectations

This course has no prerequisites. Students are not expected any background in coding.

## Learning Objectives
1.	Explore and observe patterns from raw eddy covariance data and implications towards net ecosystem exchange (NEE)
2.	Visualize and understand differences between seasons (summer vs winter) and time of day (night vs day)
3.	Discover important meteorological and phenological properties that contribute towards overall ecosystem NEE
4.	Use eddy covariance data to estimate an annual carbon budget


## Schedule and Links

Use this page to get an idea of the timeline of the module, what components are involved, and what documents are related to each component. This is the schedule intended for module deployment by the DIFUSE team, though instructors are welcome to modify the timeline to fit their course environment.

### This Module uses an RShiny web app for data visualization. Find it [here!](https://difuse-dartmouth.shinyapps.io/DIFUSEEddyCovariance/)

| Lab | The purpose of this lab therefore is to introduce you to the basics of EC, to explore raw measurement data to observe patterns of eddies across seasons and time of day, and to use relationships between ecosystem carbon fluxes and meteorological variables to estimate the annual carbon balance of an ecosystem.  | Lab Handout |[Eddy Covariance Lab Handout](components) |
